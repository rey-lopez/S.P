# Problem Statement

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose of Product

>The purpose of the project is to create a 2d game in unity called Sword Hero. The game will involve a stick figure with a sword that battles through a constant wave of enemies. The sword hero will have 3 different attack styles which include
slash, stab, and spin as well as a defense move block. There will be 4 different kinds of monsters that attack the hero in a wave each with its own weakness. The four different monsters will be different in color/appearance in order to identify 
what attack method should be used to defeat them. For each monster your hero defeats a point will be received adding to a total score for the current game. The further the hero makes it into the wave the faster the monsters will begin to attack him.
The hero will begin with a health of 2. The monsters spawned will be completely randomized to enable different attacks to be used at appropriate times. Should a monster that is weak to slash, stab, or spin reach the hero due to being attacked with the wrong style the hero will take one damage point. The fourth monster will be one that explodes and if block is not used the hero takes 2 damage losing the game. There will not be an option for regaining heatlh in the game as this is meant to be a game that lasts a few minutes at most. Once losing the game the score will be stored in the "Highscores" if it is one of the top 3 scores ever received and the heros initials will be recorded as well. 

### 1.2 Scope of Product

> The game will include a main page with a "START" and "HIGHSCORE" button. The highscore leading to a simple list of the current 3 top highscores for the game and the start button to begin playing the game. The game will include the hero, four different monsters, three different attack styles and a defensive block. The game will include a counter method to keep track of the heros current score as well as a health system monitoring how much health the hero has remaining.
